# Crystal-Images
Code utilizes HTML5, CSS and JQuery relational attributes to populate several crystal images on in separate divs on a page. Number value changes with each refresh. Idea of game is to ask a user to guess values under each crystal to subtract from the main value with goal of achieving an even 0. Code is incomplete.
